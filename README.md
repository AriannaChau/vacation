# Where Should You Go on Your Next Vacation?

#### This is a project showcasing my skills with javascript and jQuery for my Intro to Programming class at Epicodus, 2017. It's a short quiz that helps you determine where you should head on your next vacation.

#### By Arianna Chau

## Description

This is a quiz that contains five questions about you to get an idea of where you should go on your next getaway. Each answer to the questions is given a value and based on the questions you pick, the computer uses jQuery to decide where you should go out of the three destinations, Norway, Bora Bora and New York City.
